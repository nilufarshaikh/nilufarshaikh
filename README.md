## About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hi there! Iâ€™m Nilufar Shaikh.
Iâ€™m a passionate tech enthusiast with a love for coding and problem-solving. I enjoy diving deep into various technologies and frameworks, constantly learning and exploring new concepts. Coding isn't just a profession for meâ€”it's a passion. I find joy in transforming concepts into reality and creating impactful solutions.

## My Interests âœ¨
- **PHP & Laravel**: I have a strong affinity for PHP and its popular framework Laravel. I love building robust web applications with Laravel's elegant syntax and powerful features.
- **Python**: Python holds a special place in my heart. Its simplicity and versatility make it a joy to work with, whether it's scripting, web development, or data analysis.
- **Databases**: I have experience working with relational databases like MySQL, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Understanding how to design and optimize database systems is crucial for building scalable and efficient applications.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
- **Node.js & React.js**: I'm fascinated by the world of JavaScript, especially with Node.js on the backend and React.js on the frontend. Creating dynamic, interactive web applications with these technologies is both challenging and immensely rewarding. Hence I have currently enrolled myself in a Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation to learn more about these languages.
